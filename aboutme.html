                <p><strong>HEY!</strong> My name is David Pliego, but you can call me Dave Brun, I’m a freelance graphic designer currently based in Querétaro, available for both on-site and remote work. My focus is editorial design, I love that design is the key to make users more interested in editorial publications.
                    <br>
                    Beside my designs, I’m a human, I love nature, art in all kinds of forms, traveling and spending time with my buddies. 
                    
                    I’m always ready to work with new people and collaborate on projects, so if you are interested in working with me or just wanna say hi, don’t be shy and drop me a line.

                <p>Meet J. J. B. inspiration, Bruno is my childhood dog, he is the image of my brand for multiple reasons, he is loyal, funny and he is always happy. Those values are the ones I reply in my brand: I’m always looking for a loyal relation with my clients; if the brand I’m working with can be fun, I’ll work it out to make it look fun; and for last but not least, I want my brand to be perceive as happy as he is. Also, another reason that he is the image is <strong>“WHO DOESN'T WANT A DOG TO BE RELATED TO A BRAND?”.</strong></p>
